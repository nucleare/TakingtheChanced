Chrome Browser Extension that automatically collects the hourly bonus for you on [Chanced](https://www.chanced.com/c/4zfq3z)

**As of at least April 2024**, the hourly bonus on Chanced does not require a captcha to be collected and until that happens, I figured an extension to automatically do that for me would ensure I didn't have to remember visiting the site every hour. So, I made an extension to do it for me.

## What is Chanced?
[Chanced](https://www.chanced.com/c/4zfq3z) is a social casino, or what may be better known as a sweepstakes casino, where you can play casino-style games for free, without the need to gamble with real money. There are two currencies used on the site, Gold coins (GC) and Sweep coins (SC). You can use both currencies to play with but only Sweep Coins are redeemable for cash prizes. Because of this, Sweep Coins are not available for purchase and are only given away for free through promotional offers. Playing with Gold coins will help level up your VIP level and unlike Sweep Coins, cannot be used to redeem any sort of prize, it's only to play for fun and leveling up your VIP. Gold coins, however, can be purchased and often times there are Gold Coin bundles you can buy that come with free Sweep coins.

If you are already familiar with the concept, it's a site that's like a younger version of [Stake.us](stake.us/?c=Github) and more main stream than [LuckyBird](https://luckybird.io/?c=github) and unlike both, instead of dealing in cryptocurrency, Chanced offers users the ability to purchase Gold Coins with a credit or debit card and redeem prizes directly to a debit card or through ACH transfer. While they're still somewhat of a newer site and have less "Originals" games in comparison, they still offer for their Originals games like Dice, Limbo, Mines, Blackjack, and Baccarat. But, they're established enough to offer "main stream" slots from providers like Relax, Pragmatic, Hacksaw, Slotmill, BGaming, and Rogue along with Live Dealer games from Beter Live and Atmosphera.

One other thing that sets them apart from the rest, including Chumba, WoW Vegas, GlobalPoker, etc. is that their daily bonus isn't a daily bonus, it's an hourly bonus. Where, as of April 2024, consists of 1000 GC and 0.1 SC. However, their redemption minimnum is 100 SC.

If you're not already on the site, use [this link](https://www.chanced.com/c/4zfq3z) to sign-up and get 2.0 SC to start after verification. Sweepstakes play (or SC) is only open to US Residents (excluding the states of Idaho, Michigan, Nevada, Kentucky, and Washington).
