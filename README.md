# TakingtheChanced
Chrome Browser Extension that helps ensure the collection of the hourly bonus on [Chanced](https://www.chanced.com/c/4zfq3z)

_Last checked as working April 2024_

# How it Works
It connects to your neural pathways and executes mouse functions dictated by your mind every hour or otherwise, it installs inactive. Click on the extension icon to activate. Click it again to deactivate. Every time you re-activate the extension, the internal timer resets, it presently runs every 61-64 minutes. If you hope to run this for long periods of time, I suggest you increase that intermittency range in `background.js` Line 36 `getRandomTime(61, 64)` to avoid being turned into C3PO or R2D2.

### PLEASE BE ADVISED
Running this with its current settings for long periods of times may result in failure. You'll know when the tab doesn't close on it's own. Therefore...

## Requirements & Caveats
You must be logged into [Chanced](https://www.chanced.com/c/4zfq3z) for it to work. Make sure your login is saved so that the page to collect loads properly as it is designed to navigate directly to the bonus collection page. This extension will stop working if they decide to add a Kappa emoji with Chai Tea for verification before collecting the bonus like every other site out there, so I don't doubt it'll be here one day. Until then, _Carpe diem_.

It's recommended that you start (or activate) the extension when your hourly bonus is available. Just... for efficiency's sake. And, if you see what it does when you activate it, you won't be wondering what it does.

## Permissions
Wondering about Saving Private Ryan? Here's the explanations:
 - "alarms": Allows scheduling actions.
 - "scripting": Needed to translate your mental will into clicking actions.
 - "tabs": Enables opening a new tab and instantly switching back to your original tab with the blink of your eyes.
 - "<all_urls>": Ensures the extension can run while you're watching po- I mean, viewing other websites. It might work if you change this permission, but the service worker doesn't do anything during it's 1-hour lunch break that it takes every hour so it's not *running up a tab* or anything. *pun intended*
 - "storage": For preserving the extension state

# What is Chanced?
[Chanced](https://www.chanced.com/c/4zfq3z) is a social casino, or what may be better known as a sweepstakes casino, where you can play casino-style games for free, without the need to gamble with real money. There are two currencies used on the site, Gold coins (GC) and Sweep coins (SC). You can use both currencies to play with but only Sweep Coins are redeemable for cash prizes. Because of this, Sweep Coins are not available for purchase and are only given away for free through promotional offers. Playing with Gold coins will help level up your VIP level and unlike Sweep Coins, cannot be used to redeem any sort of prize, it's only to play for fun and leveling up your VIP. Gold coins, however, can be purchased and often times there are Gold Coin bundles you can buy that come with free Sweep coins.

If you are already familiar with the concept, it's a site that's like a younger version of [Stake.us](stake.us/?c=Github) and more main stream than [LuckyBird](https://luckybird.io/?c=github) and unlike both, instead of dealing in cryptocurrency, Chanced offers users the ability to purchase Gold Coins with a credit or debit card and redeem prizes directly to a debit card or through ACH transfer. While they're still somewhat of a newer site and have less "Originals" games in comparison, they still offer for their Originals games like Dice, Limbo, Mines, Blackjack, and Baccarat. But, they're established enough to offer "main stream" slots from providers like Relax, Pragmatic, Hacksaw, Slotmill, BGaming, and Rogue along with Live Dealer games from Beter Live and Atmosphera.

One other thing that sets them apart from the rest, including Chumba, WoW Vegas, GlobalPoker, etc. is that their daily bonus isn't a daily bonus, it's an hourly bonus. Where, as of April 2024, consists of 1000 GC and 0.1 SC. However, their redemption minimnum is 100 SC.

If you're not already on the site, use [this link](https://www.chanced.com/c/4zfq3z) to sign-up and get 2.0 SC to start after verification. Sweepstakes play (or SC) is only open to US Residents (excluding the states of Idaho, Michigan, Nevada, Kentucky, and Washington).
